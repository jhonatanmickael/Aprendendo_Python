# Merge Sorted Array

## Description
Given two sorted integer arrays, your task is to merge them into a single sorted list within a single array. You must modify the first array in-place instead of using an extra array. Assume that the first array has enough space to store all elements from the second array.

## Examples

**Input:**
- `nums1`: [1, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
- `nums2`: [2, 4, 6]

**Output:**
- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
